# Advancing SWAT Reservoir Operations 

## Overview
This repository contains the code used to optimize reservoir operations, run system simulations, perform analyses, and make figures in support of:

Jordan SM, Quinn JD, Zaniolo, M, Giuliani M, Castelletti A. 2022. Advancing reservoir operations modelling in SWAT to
reduce socio-ecological tradeoffs. In prep.

## Folder Structure
`Optimization`: contains the wrapper used to optimize existing and updated reservoir operations using Borg (license required). 
`OmoScenarios`: setting up and running SWAT scenarios for each optimized reservoir operating policy under historical and climate change conditions. 
`SWATfiles`: relevant assets for running SWAT and calculating objectives for both existing and updated SWAT reservoir operations. 
`MakeFigures`: code used to make figures for the paper.


## Additional Code
* [SWAT source code updates](https://github.com/sjordan29/SWAT-source-code-updates)
* [Climate projection downscaling & debiasing](https://github.com/sjordan29/omo-cmip-downscaling-debias)
